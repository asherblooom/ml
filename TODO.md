- check all files for comments etc.
- pick best enesmble method ??
- check random search CV works and check distributions are okay - think they are using scipi.stats package. need to pick different one a la labs??
- in report task 1, check if 'Intercept' is a valid feature and should be included. Also check for task3.py whether we need real dollar values
- check if we should be commenting on bayseian linear regression for report task 2 or not (probably not...)
- finalise and polish task 1 report
- remove commented out '.fit' in all task 2 code, if it truly makes no difference because the randomised CV does it for us (as ai says)
